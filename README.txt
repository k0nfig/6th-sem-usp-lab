List of Experiments for USP: Design, develop, and execute thefollowing programs

1. Write a C/C++ POSIX compliant program to check the followinglimits:
(i) No. of clock ticks (ii) Max.no. of child processes
(iii) Max. path length
(iv) Max. no. of characters in a file name
(v) Max. no.of open files/ process

2. Write a C/C++ POSIX compliant program that prints the POSIXdefined configuration options supported on any given system usingfeature test macros.

3. Consider the last 100 bytes as a region. Write a C/C++ program tocheck whether the region is locked or not. If the region is locked,print pid of the process which has locked. If the region is not locked,lock the region with an exclusive lock, read the last 50 bytes andunlock the region.

4. Write a C/C++ program which demonstrates interprocesscommunication between a reader process and a writer process. Usemkfifo, open, read, write and close APIs in your program.

5. a) Write a C/C++ program that outputs the contents of itsEnvironment list
5.  b) Write a C / C++ program to emulate the unix ln command

6. Write a C/C++ program to illustrate the race condition.

7. Write a C/C++ program that creates a zombie and then calls systemto execute the pscommand to verify that the process is zombie.

8. Write a C/C++ program to avoid zombie process by forking twice.

9. Write a C/C++ program to implement the system function.

10. Write a C/C++ program to set up a real-time clock interval timerusing the alarm API
